  I am currently an Master Student in Urban Spatial Analytics at University of Pennsylvania. I am interested in data-driven mathematical modeling, statistical inference and forecast of health disparity issues. With interdisciplinary backgrounds in statistics, mathematics and spatial analysis, I study the spatiotemporal analysis of diseases at both population and individual levels. My recent research work involves the development of statistical models to predict spatial variations of readmission outcomes.
