  I am currently an Master Student in Program of Urban Spatial Analytics at Penn Institute for Urban Research, University of Pennsylvania. I am interested in data-driven mathematical modeling, statistical inference and forecast of health disparity issues. With interdisciplinary backgrounds in statistics, mathematics and spatial analysis, I study the spatiotemporal analysis of diseases at both population and individual levels. Using dynamical models informed by empirical data, my recent research work involves the development of forecast models to predict spatial variations of readmission outcomes across Philadelphia neighborhoods. In addition, I investigate how spatial models such as space time diffusion can be harnessed to improve disease surveillance, forecast and intervention.
